Making a smartcontract lottery

Drafting:
1. Raffle
2. Enter the lottery (By paying some amount)
3. Pick a random winner (verifiably random)
4. Winner is selected ever X minutes -> Automate this process
5. Use Chainlink oracle -> Verifiably random, Automate execution (chainlink keepers)

Notes:
Going more into depth about Chainlink VRF v2 and Chainlink Keepers.
Learning how to use VRF

IMPORT CHAINLINK/CONTRACTS steps:
- To import a git repo, like with Chainlink, use the npm commmand and you can now use
the functions that are a part of that repository:

npm add --include @chainlink/contracts

- Then we add the chainlink contract to our Raffle.sol and use the VRFConsumerBaseV2 
abstract contract to gain access to our ability to get a random number function.

** Run this command to be sure the contract compile correctly : npx hardhat compile 


The requestRandomWords() from the VRFConsumerBaseV2 contract :
function requestRandomWords()
        external
        onlyOwner
        returns (uint256 requestId)
    {
        // Will revert if subscription is not set and funded.
        requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords(
            keyHash,
            s_subscriptionId,
            requestConfirmations,
            callbackGasLimit,
            numWords
        );
        s_requests[requestId] = RequestStatus({
            randomWords: new uint256[](0),
            exists: true,
            fulfilled: false
        });
        requestIds.push(requestId);
        lastRequestId = requestId;
        emit RequestSent(requestId, numWords);
        return requestId;
    }

LEARNING CHAINLINK KEEPERS

We need a check upkeep and perform upkeep function for our contract.

CheckUpKeepFunction() = checks to see if it is time to get a random number to update the recent winner and send them the funds

For the import, the location changed for KeepersCompatibleInterface. It is located under @chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/interfaces/KeepersCompatibleInterface.sol

When getting a timestamp, Solidity has a built in tool. `block.timestamp`


OTHER Notes

If variable is a constant, when making a getter that is associated with it, you have to say `pure` instead of `view`. view is used with state variables.
